# Sentimental-Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral.   
In the preprocessing I removed stopwords and applied stemmings and WordNetLemmatizer. I used RandomForestClassifier to predict sentiments.   
The Accuracy score of the model was found to be 0.93925.
